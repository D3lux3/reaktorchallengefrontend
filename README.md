## About the project

The frontend's purpose is to be a userfriendly way for the warehouse workers to check the stock status of specific items.

The frontend uses pagination to be more faster for the user. 

The frontend has been made using Typescript, React and the UI is made using Material-UI.

Unfortunately the first load of the website is pretty slow, because it fetches the data from the bad-api.

Backend: https://github.com/D3lux3/reaktorchallengebackend
